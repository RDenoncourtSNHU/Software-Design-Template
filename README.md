# Software-Design-Template
**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**  
The client was the Gaming Room and they were looking to expand their game, Draw It or Lose It, to more users instead of just Android. Thier intent was to create a web based version of their app that could easily be shared across multiple platforms.  
**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**  
I felt the most comfortable describing the UML diagram. I haven't been the biggest fan of UML diagrams in the past but once they are fully completed, it makes it much easier to see the general flow of the code.  
**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**  
The biggest thing that helps with the design document when it comes to coding is having a gameplan. Far too often, I'll jump into a project with just a rough idea in my head. I'll end up hitting a wall that I probably would've predicted had I just taken some time to plan the whole project out.  
**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**  
I feel like there is a little redundency in the evaluation table. Since this was a web based app, the client side of the operating system didn't really matter all that much.
**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**  
One of the examples of meeting their needs is that they wanted only one instance of the game to exist in memory at any given time. I accomplished this by turning the game instance class into a singleton. In this case, it was important to consider the user's needs since it was our client and they were paying us to do so. In general though, we want the client to enjoy the product and have a smooth experience.  
**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**  
It's very easy to get lost in a project. You can end up trying to dig your self out of unneccessary holes. Using a software design template complete with UML diagrams can help see your long term roadmap and minimize any surprises you might come across along the way. We all know coding is the fun part but it's vital to be prepared especially when there is a team and deadlines involved.
